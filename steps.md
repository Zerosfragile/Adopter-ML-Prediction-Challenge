# Create a better model

Given that the current F1-score is 0.827 and the target is 0.15, it seems that the current model is overfitting to the training data and is not generalizing well to new data. Here are some steps that you can take to improve the performance of the model and achieve the target F1-score:

Feature selection: It is important to carefully select the most relevant features for the problem. You can use techniques such as correlation analysis, recursive feature elimination, or Lasso regularization to identify the most important features for the model.

Hyperparameter tuning: XGBoost has many hyperparameters that can be tuned to optimize the performance of the model. You can use techniques such as GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to find the best combination of hyperparameter values.

Cross-validation: Cross-validation is a technique for estimating the performance of a machine learning model on new data. By using cross-validation, you can get a better estimate of the true performance of the model and avoid overfitting.

Ensemble methods: Ensemble methods such as bagging, boosting, and stacking can be used to improve the performance of machine learning models. For example, you can try using a combination of different XGBoost models or combining XGBoost with other machine learning algorithms to create a more powerful ensemble model.

Addressing class imbalance: Class imbalance can be a challenge for classification problems. You can experiment with different techniques for handling class imbalance, such as oversampling, undersampling, or using different cost functions.

Model interpretation: It is important to interpret the results of the model and understand the factors that contribute to the prediction. You can use techniques such as feature importance analysis, partial dependence plots, or SHAP values to interpret the model and gain insights into the underlying relationships in the data.

By experimenting with these different approaches, you can improve the performance of the XGBoost model and achieve a higher F1-score that meets the target.
